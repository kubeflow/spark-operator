## Introduction

This chart bootstraps a [Kubernetes Operator for Apache Spark]({{template "chart.homepage" . }}) deployment using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

## Prerequisites

- Helm >= 3
- Kubernetes >= 1.16

## Previous Helm Chart

The previous `spark-operator` Helm chart hosted at [helm/charts](https://github.com/helm/charts) has been moved to this repository in accordance with the [Deprecation timeline](https://github.com/helm/charts#deprecation-timeline). Note that a few things have changed between this version and the old version:

- This repository **only** supports Helm chart installations using Helm 3+ since the `apiVersion` on the chart has been marked as `v2`.
- Previous versions of the Helm chart have not been migrated, and the version has been set to `1.0.0` at the onset. If you are looking for old versions of the chart, it's best to run `helm pull incubator/sparkoperator --version <your-version>` until you are ready to move to this repository's version.
- Several configuration properties have been changed, carefully review the [values](#values) section below to make sure you're aligned with the new values.

## Usage

### Add Helm Repo

```shell
helm repo add spark-operator https://kubeflow.github.io/spark-operator

helm repo update
```

See [helm repo](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo) for command documentation.

### Install the chart

```shell
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] spark-operator/spark-operator
```

For example, if you want to create a release with name `spark-operator` in the `spark-operator` namespace:

```shell
helm install spark-operator spark-operator/spark-operator \
    --namespace spark-operator \
    --create-namespace
```

Note that by passing the `--create-namespace` flag to the `helm install` command, `helm` will create the release namespace if it does not exist.

See [helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install) for command documentation.

### Upgrade the chart

```shell
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] spark-operator/spark-operator [flags]
```

See [helm upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade) for command documentation.

### Uninstall the chart

```shell
helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

This removes all the Kubernetes resources associated with the chart and deletes the release, except for the `crds`, those will have to be removed manually.

See [helm uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall) for command documentation.

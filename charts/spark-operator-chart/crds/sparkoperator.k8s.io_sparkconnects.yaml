                              of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver
                              traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading
                              the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will
                              be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of
                              routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other
                              features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from
                              within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to
                              a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account
                              when picking a node.

                              TrafficDistribution offers a way to express preferences for how traffic is
                              distributed to Service endpoints. Implementations can use this field as a
                              hint, but are not required to guarantee strict adherence. If the field is
                              not set, the implementation will apply its default routing strategy. If set
                              to "PreferClose", implementations should prioritize endpoints that are
                              topologically close (e.g., same zone).
                              This is a beta field and requires enabling ServiceTrafficDistribution feature.

                              type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to ClusterIP. Valid
                              options are ExternalName, ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer.
                              "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
                              to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is not
                              specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
                              EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
                              allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
                              than a virtual IP.
                              "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port on every node which
                              routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
                              "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer
                              (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints
                              as the clusterIP.
                              "ExternalName" aliases this service to the specified externalName.
                              Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services.

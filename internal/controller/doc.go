package controller

// Package controller implements the CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) controller for SparkApplications and
// ScheduledSparkApplications.
//
// The ScheduledSparkApplication controller is responsible for watching ScheduledSparkApplications objects
// and scheduling them according to the cron schedule in the ScheduledSparkApplication specification. For
// each ScheduledSparkApplication, the controller creates a new SparkApplication instance when the next run
// of the application is due and the condition for starting the next run is satisfied.
//
// The SparkApplication controller is responsible for watching SparkApplication objects and submitting
// Spark applications described by the specs in the objects on behalf of users. After an application is
// submitted, the controller monitors the application state and updates the status field of the
// SparkApplication object accordingly. The controller uses a sparkSubmitRunner to submit applications
// to run in the Kubernetes cluster where Spark Operator runs. The sparkSubmitRunner maintains a set of
// workers, each of which is a goroutine, for actually running the spark-submit commands. The controller
// also uses a sparkPodMonitor to watch Spark driver and executor pods. The sparkPodMonitor sends driver
// and executor state updates to the controller, which then updates status field of SparkApplication
// objects accordingly.
